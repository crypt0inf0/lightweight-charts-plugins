# Lightweight Charts Rectangle Tool

 This and all the line tools are converted from the [3.8 build](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools) via **Vibe Coding** and painstakingly tested by me to ensure it's not AI slop.

This package provides a specialized **Rectangle** drawing tool for the [Lightweight Charts v5+](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts) plugin system. It allows traders to highlight specific areas of price action with filled boxes and optional text labels. It is part of a modular, high-performance **drop-in replacement** suite for the legacy [v3.8 Line Tools Build](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools).

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

**<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT:</span>** This plugin **cannot** function on its own. It requires the **Core Orchestrator** to handle interactions, rendering logic, and state management.

*   **Required Core:** [lightweight-charts-line-tools-core](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-core) . Have a look at the core repository to learn how to make your own line tools utilizing the core and contribute.

## 🛠 Installation & Building

This package is distributed as source code. To use it, you must clone the repository and build the distribution files locally.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle.git
    cd lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    *(This will automatically download the Core orchestrator and other required libraries)*
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the plugin**:
    *(This generates the /dist folder and /docs)*
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Output**:
    *   `/dist`: Contains the production ESM and UMD bundles.
    *   `/docs`: Technical API documentation. Open `docs/index.html` and navigate to the `LineToolRectangle` class to view all available configuration options (background fill, border radius, border styles, text labels) and methods.

## 📦 The Plugin Ecosystem

**<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT</span>:** The Core package is strictly an orchestrator; it does **<span style="color:red">NOT include any line tools by default. To use any drawing functionality, you must install the specific tool plugins you require and register them with the Core instance.</span>** This modular approach allows you to keep your application footprint as small as possible by only including the logic for the tools you actually use.

## 🚀 Usage Example

Here is how to register and use the Rectangle tool in your chart.

```typescript
import { createChart, CandlestickSeries } from 'lightweight-charts';
import { createLineToolsPlugin } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-core';
import { LineToolRectangle } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle';

const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('chart-container'));
const series = chart.addSeries(CandlestickSeries);

// 1. Initialize the Core Orchestrator
const lineTools = createLineToolsPlugin(chart, series);

// 2. Register the Rectangle Tool
lineTools.registerLineTool('Rectangle', LineToolRectangle);

// 3. Start interactive drawing mode (Click Start corner, then move and Click opposite corner)
lineTools.addLineTool('Rectangle');
```

# The Test App

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

For developers and contributors, I provide a dedicated **[React Test Application](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-plugin-test-app)**. 

This app is used to verify the integrity of the Core and all 12 plugins (21 line tools). It features an **Automated Test Surface Generator** that produces massive grids of tools to validate every style property, culling edge-case, and coordinate interpolation variant in a single view. Turn on the subscriptions and double click any tool you see to get its properties - options to understand what options do what. This is also a visual way to confirm all aspects of the tool are working properly.
