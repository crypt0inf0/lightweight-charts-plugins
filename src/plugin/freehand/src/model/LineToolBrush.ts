 * **What is a Brush Tool?**
 * A Brush tool allows the user to draw continuous, freehand lines by clicking and dragging
 * the mouse. It captures a stream of points as the mouse moves.
 *
 * **Key Characteristics:**
 * - **Unbounded Points:** `pointsCount: -1` (it can have any number of points).
 * - **MouseUp Finalization:** Drawing ends when the mouse button is released.
 * - **Point Filtering:** Implements `addPoint` override to filter out redundant points
 *   (i.e., points too close to the last one).
